<h3>ORMUS Research Ideas</h3>

<p>Inspiration struck this morning. I am taking a break from software development so I can use this page to talk about ORMUS/ORME research ideas. Once I know more about HTML I can make separate pages for the two topics, but for today I am writing this here.</p>

<p>During my ORMUS/ORME experiences I witnessed beautiful things. Beautiful things.</p>
<p>These materials, once properly understood and safely harnessed, hold the potential to completely change our way of life. These materials can change our existence, and they can do it on a deeply personal level.</p>
<p>They have the potential to do that. Whether or not they actually will is anyone’s guess. Like many super-good things, I wouldn’t be surprised if they were suppressed by existing power structures.</p>
<p>I think an elegant solution to that problem is to just change their minds… I truly think if “they” knew of the remarkable properties of these substances,and the wonderful experiences they facilitate, they would seek to have those benefits in their own lives.</p>
<p>But a keyword here is “safety.” After having my own ORMUS experiences, I think there are many questions that need to be answered before they can understood and used safely.
Many people report being able to safely ingest ORMUS, but I have questions about the long term safety of these substances. I will edit this and get to those shortly. I am being microwaved by my computer again and it’s killing my vibe so I will just make a list of research ideas</p>
<p>I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW MAGICAL MY ORMUS EXPERIENCES WERE. The experiential wonder that comes with ingesting ORMUS is due, I believe, to the larger amounts of life force that flow through the body when they are ingested. ORMUS seems to be a facilitator of the life force, allowing more of it to flow through the body at once, and you might not even need ORMUS to do this. I would love to see research into alternate methods of accomplishing this.</p>
<ol>
<li>Heavy metal content of ORMUS</li>
<li>A more complete understanding of the relationship between ORMUS the precipitate and Orbitally Rearranged Monoatomic Elements (ORMEs)
<li>Potential degradation of ORMEs around electromagnetic fields or over time</li>
<li>Responsiveness of ORMEs to different types electromagnetic fields</li> 
<li>Resilience of ORMEs around electromagnetic fields.</li>
<li>Orgone energy that accompanies the presence of ORMEs</li>
<li>Measuring reservoirs of orgone energy</li>
<li>The creation of orgone reservoirs during the creation of ORMEs/ORMUS</li>
<li>Whether ORMEs respond differently to electromagnetic radiation while they are in orgone reservoirs</li>
<li>VERY IMPORTANT: SAFELY INGESTING ORMES THROUGH FOOD</li>
<li>Finding a way to test ORMUS-grown produce for heavy metal content. Maybe just testing soil concentrations and then seeing how well the food grows with/without it.</li>
<li>(Or if any possible heavy metals would still be as harmful for human health if bound up in the food) Feed heavy metal laden ORME food to mice or something and see how they grow. Test their brains/nervous systems for heavy metal deposits and overall health if you can.</li>
<li>Assaying wet/dry precipitate for heavy metal content</li>
<li>Assaying for Gilchrist heavy metal precipitates at or at increments above 10.78 pH</li>
<li>Radioactive decay through either transmutation of superdeformed nuclei or from when ORMEs degrade from high spin state</li>
<li>Questioning whether or not ORMEs and ORMUS are even needed to facilitate the induction of larger amounts of life force into the body (which I believe is responsible for the “magical experience” of feeling/thinking deeper.) There might be better ways to accomplish this.</li>
<li>Orgone reservoirs of varying strength and their effects on animal growth and behavior</li>
<li>Transferring animals from low stregnth orgone reservoirs to high strength ones to see if they can adapt</li>
<li>Breaking point. How much orgone energy is too much?</li>


</ol>
