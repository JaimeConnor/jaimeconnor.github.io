<h6>ORMUS Research Ideas</h6>

<p>Inspiration struck this morning. I am taking a break from software development so I can use this page to talk about ORMUS/ORME research ideas. Once I know more about HTML I can make separate pages for the two topics, but for today I am writing this here.</p>

<p>During my ORMUS/ORME experiences I witnessed beautiful things. Beautiful things.</p>
<p>These materials, once properly understood and safely harnessed, hold the potential to completely change our way of life. These materials can change our existence, and they can do it on a deeply personal level.</p>
<p>They have the potential to do that. Whether or not they actually will is anyone’s guess. Like many super-good things, I wouldn’t be surprised if they were suppressed by existing power structures.</p>
<p>I think an elegant solution to that problem is to just change their minds… I truly think if “they” knew of the remarkable properties of these substances,and the wonderful experiences they facilitate, they would seek them out to have those benefits in their own lives.</p>
<p>But a keyword here is “safety.” After having my own ORMUS experiences, I think there are many questions that need to be answered before they can understood and safely harnessed.</p>
