<h3>ORMUS Research Ideas</h3>

<p>Inspiration struck this morning. I am taking a break from software development so I can use this page to talk about ORMUS/ORME research ideas. Once I know more about HTML I can make separate pages for the two topics, but for today I am writing this here.</p>

<p>During my ORMUS/ORME experiences I witnessed beautiful things. Beautiful things.</p>
<p>These materials, once properly understood and safely harnessed, hold the potential to completely change our way of life. These materials can change our existence, and they can do it on a deeply personal level.</p>
<p>They have the potential to do that. Whether or not they actually will is anyone’s guess. Like many super-good things, I wouldn’t be surprised if they were suppressed by existing power structures.</p>
<p>I think an elegant solution to that problem is to just change their minds… I truly think if “they” knew of the remarkable properties of these substances,and the wonderful experiences they facilitate, they would seek to have those benefits in their own lives.</p>
<p>But a keyword here is “safety.” After having my own ORMUS experiences, I think there are many questions that need to be answered before they can understood and used safely.
Many people report being able to safely ingest ORMUS, but I have questions about the long term safety of these substances. I will edit this and get to those shortly. I am being microwaved by my computer again and it’s killing my vibe so I will just make a list of research ideas</p>
<ol>
<li>Heavy metal content of ORMUS</li>
<li>A more complete understanding of the relationship between ORMUS the precipitate and Orbitally Rearranged Monoatomic Elements (ORMEs)
<li>Potential degradation of ORMEs around electromagnetic fields or over time</li>
<li>Responsiveness of ORMEs to different types electromagnetic fields</li> 
<li>Resilience of ORMEs around electromagnetic fields.</li>
<li>Orgone energy that accompanies the presence of ORMEs</li>
<li>Measuring reservoirs of orgone energy</li>
<li>The creation of orgone reservoirs during the creation of ORMEs/ORMUS</li>
<li>Whether ORMEs respond differently to electromagnetic radiation while they are in orgone reservoirs</li>

</ol>
